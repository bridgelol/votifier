# NuVotifier+++++++
Fork of [NuVotifier](https://github.com/NuVotifier/NuVotifier) with additional features like standalone support and redis forwarding.

NuVotifier is a secure alternative to using the original Votifier project.
NuVotifier will work in place of Votifier - any vote listener that supports
Votifier will also support NuVotifier.

NuVotifier supports many different platforms using the same universal JAR:

+ Bukkit / Spigot / Paper >=1.20
+ Sponge 7
+ BungeeCord / Waterfall
+ Velocity
+ Standalone (Added by [Netherite](https://netherite.gg)), requires [Redis](https://redis.io)

NuVotifier also adds forwarding and listener test commands not present in the
original version.
